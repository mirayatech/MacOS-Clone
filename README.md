# macOS Big Sur Clone üçè

A macOS desktop clone. I created this project out of fascination for the Mac/Apple desktop UI and wanted to try to replicate it as closely as possible, even with the dynamic dock behavior.

## ‚ö° Technologies

- `Vite`
- `React.js`
- `TypeScript`
- `Zustand`
- `Framer Motion`

## üí≠ Process

I began by gathering all the necessary images for the dock and wallpaper. Then, I established constants and implemented Zustand for state management. Next, I worked on the navigation bar and system preference color functionalities. After that, I tackled the dynamic dock, which was a bit challenging to animate. Each dock item scales slightly when selected, creating a realistic effect. I also created a settings modal, allowing users to switch between dark and light modes and change background colors.

## ü§î How can it be improved?

To enhance this project, consider adding more interactivity by making features like the calculator and calendar docks functional. Essentially, aim to replicate the full functionality of the macOS desktop.
